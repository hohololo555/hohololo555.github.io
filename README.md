# DISCLAIMER: I rarely maintain this, some games may no longer work 

Im just experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JS

its a games website its full of games and proxies and stuff not allowed in school, have fun

the features available can be seen in either the unencrypted-index or the names of the files in the root directory

feel free to make your own branch I'll check em out when I have time to merge them
## Deployment

- To deploy this project clone the repository and host the unencrypted-index.html file as the main index.html
- The entire repo is around 4 gigabytes so keep that in mind if you want to clone it



## Documentation

- The index.html file in the root directory is a VERY simple tab cloaker I made that makes it look like youre on Canvas whenever you switch tabs, also keeps search history records to a minimum
    - it uses an iFrame that points to encrypted.html, change that if needed
    - any feature hosted on external websites or services is accessed using the same iframe code but with the link swapped



## TO-DO:

Here's my list of things to do on here, idk if I will but hey I'll try, or you can, best of luck

- make the homepage look better
- get rid of non-functional features
- add more games/proxies/features
- finish the about:blank site cloak to completely hide from search history
